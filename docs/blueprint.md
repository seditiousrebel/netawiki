- Background color: Light gray (#E8E8EA), same hue as the primary color but desaturated, to ensure readability and a clean interface.

- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif), which will provide a modern, clean and fashionable look to headings, and pair with 'Inter'.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), used in conjunction with 'Poppins', is a grotesque-style sans-serif providing the main text a machined, neutral, objective look.
- Use icons with a consistent, simple style. Icons should clearly represent their associated function or content.
